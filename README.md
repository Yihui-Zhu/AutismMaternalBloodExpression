# Autism Maternal Blood Expression

Analysis scripts on peripheral maternal blood gene expression associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) outcome in a MARBLES prospective autism study in three trimesters during pregnancy.

Step 1: QC preprocessing in all three trimesters

Step 2: Each trimesters differential expression (DE) on maternal blood

Step 3: Functional enrichment test and overlapped DE probes among trimesters

Step 4: Correlation next analysis
