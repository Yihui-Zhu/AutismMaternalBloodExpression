# Autism Maternal Blood Expression

Analysis scripts on peripheral maternal blood gene expression associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) outcome in a MARBLES prospective autism study in three trimesters during pregnancy.

Step 1: QC preprocessing in all three trimesters

Step 2: Each trimesters differential expression (DE) on maternal blood

Step 3: Functional enrichment test and overlapped DE probes among trimesters

Step 4: Correlation next analysis

### Title: Expression changes in immune and epigenetic gene pathways associated with nutritional metabolites in maternal blood from pregnancies resulting in autism and atypical neurodevelopment

### Abstract: 
#### Background: 
The prenatal period is a critical window to study factors involved in the development of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Environmental factors, especially in utero nutrition, can interact with genetic risk for ASD, but how specific prenatal nutrients in mothers of children later diagnosed with ASD or non-typical development (Non-TD) associate with gestational gene expression is poorly understood. Maternal blood collected prospectively during pregnancy provides a new opportunity to gain insights into nutrition, particularly one-carbon metabolites, on gene pathways and neurodevelopment.
